# Customer Data Update and Mainframe Interaction

This repository contains Python code exploring the process of reading customer data from a CSV file, performing basic validation, and a conceptual approach to updating this information on a mainframe system.

**Note:** This project represents an initial exploration and was ultimately not implemented due to limitations with the target mainframe's macro-based rejection of this approach.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project was to investigate the feasibility of automating customer data updates from a standard file format (CSV) to a legacy mainframe system. The aim was to provide a framework for:

1.  Reading customer data from a source file.
2.  Validating the data for completeness and correctness.
3.  Programmatically interacting with a mainframe to update customer records.

## Project Structure

The key components of the provided code include:

*   `read_customer_data(filepath)`: A function to read customer data from a specified CSV file into a pandas DataFrame. Includes basic error handling for file not found and other potential issues.
*   `validate_customer_data(df)`: A function to perform basic validation on the DataFrame, checking for required fields and missing values in critical columns. This function can be extended with more complex validation rules.
*   `update_customer_on_mainframe(customer_record)`: A **placeholder** function representing the interaction with the mainframe. In a real-world scenario, this would contain the logic for connecting to, navigating, and updating data on the mainframe using appropriate methods (e.g., screen scraping libraries, APIs, file transfers).

## Important Considerations and Challenges

This project highlighted several significant challenges and considerations for interacting with mainframe systems:

*   **Mainframe Access and Interaction:** The core challenge was understanding and implementing programmatic interaction with the specific mainframe environment. This requires detailed knowledge of the mainframe's interface, communication protocols, and security measures. Our attempt was ultimately blocked by the mainframe's reliance on MACROs, which rejected this approach.
*   **Security:** Handling sensitive customer data and mainframe access credentials securely is paramount. Robust security protocols and practices are essential.
*   **Scalability and Performance:** For large volumes of data updates, optimizing the data processing and mainframe interaction logic is crucial to ensure efficient and timely execution.
*   **Maintainability:** Mainframe interfaces and data requirements can change. Designing the interaction layer to be modular and adaptable is important for long-term maintainability.

## Usage (Conceptual)

While the mainframe interaction is a placeholder, the data reading and validation functions can be used independently.

1.  **Read Data:**
        customer_data = read_customer_data('customer_updates.csv')
        if customer_data is not None:
          print("Data read successfully:")
          print(customer_data.head())
2.  **Validate Data:**
        if validate_customer_data(customer_data):
            print("Data validation successful.")
        else:
            print("Data validation failed.")
3.  **Mainframe Update (Placeholder):**
        if customer_data is not None and validate_customer_data(customer_data):
        for index, row in customer_data.iterrows():
          if update_customer_on_mainframe(row):
            print(f"Simulated update success for customer {row['customer_id']}.")
          else:
            print(f"Simulated update failed for customer {row['customer_id']}.")
Replace `'customer_updates.csv'` with the actual path to your data file.

## Conclusion

This project served as a valuable learning experience in exploring the complexities of mainframe integration. While the specific approach was unsuccessful due to the mainframe's limitations, the code demonstrates fundamental steps in data processing and highlights the critical considerations for working with legacy systems.
