Python Snippets for Common Tasks:

1. Reading Data from a CSV file:
"""

import pandas as pd

def read_customer_data(filepath):
    """Reads customer data from a CSV file."""
    try:
        df = pd.read_csv(filepath)
        return df
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File not found at {filepath}")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while reading the file: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage:
# customer_data = read_customer_data('customer_updates.csv')
# if customer_data is not None:
#     print("Data read successfully:")
#     print(customer_data.head())

"""2. Basic Data Validation:"""

import pandas as pd

def validate_customer_data(df):
    """Performs basic data validation."""
    # Check for missing required fields
    required_fields = ['customer_id', 'customer_name']
    for field in required_fields:
        if field not in df.columns:
            print(f"Error: Missing required column '{field}'")
            return False
        if df[field].isnull().any():
            print(f"Error: Missing values in column '{field}'")
            return False

    # Add more validation rules as needed (e.g., data type checks, format validation)

    return True

# Example usage:
# if validate_customer_data(customer_data):
#     print("Data validation successful.")
# else:
#     print("Data validation failed.")

"""3. Placeholder for Mainframe Interaction (We used a simplified example):"""

def update_customer_on_mainframe(customer_record):
    """
    Placeholder function for interacting with the mainframe.
    This would be replaced with actual code to interact with the mainframe
    using screen scraping, APIs, or file transfers.
    """
    print(f"Simulating updating customer on mainframe: {customer_record['customer_id']}")
    # In a real scenario, this would involve sending commands or data
    # to the mainframe and handling the response.
    # Return True on success, False on failure
    return True

# Example usage:
# for index, row in customer_data.iterrows():
#     if update_customer_on_mainframe(row):
#         print(f"Customer {row['customer_id']} updated successfully.")
#     else:
#         print(f"Failed to update customer {row['customer_id']}.")

"""Important Considerations:

*   Mainframe Access: This is the biggest hurdle we faced. I try to understand how to programmatically interact with our specific mainframe system. Consulted with our IT department and mainframe administrators for guidance.
* Security: We Ensured secure handling of sensitive customer data and access credentials for the mainframe.  
*   Scalability and Performance: For a large number of updates, consider optimizing the data processing and mainframe interaction to ensure good performance.
*   Maintainability: Designed the framework to be modular and easy to maintain, especially if the mainframe interface or data requirements change.

The real-world implementation gives me significant effort to understand the mainframe system, implement robust error handling, and build a user-friendly interface.

But it's a failure project for me. Due to MACRO the rejects this approach!
